            While I'm not learning and advancing my knowledge in code to better my techniques and skills,
             I do some of the following to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

                Bouldering is rock climbing stripped down to its raw essentials. 
                Leaving behind ropes and harnesses and just using climbing shoes and a bag of chalk over safety mats,
                your challenge is to climb short but tricky bouldering "problems" (a route, or sequence of moves) using balance, 
                technique, strength, and your brain.

                I've been bouldering on and off for the past 8 months and quite enjoy the challenge that comes with analyzing and
                problem solving the route, and where to place your hands and feet for which rock to reach towards the top.

                I've been playing video games since I was a young kid at the age of 5, I remember my first console being the Playstation
                1 and playing Crash Bandicoot. After that I always tended to stick with Sony and my favorite set of classic games From
                the Playstation 2 being Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series, Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Destroy All Humans.

                <br>    
                Now I mainly play games on PC such as League of Legends, Apex, and a couple other singleplayer games. I still play on
                console since they release some really great exclusive games that are artistic and separate themselves from the usual 
                releases.
